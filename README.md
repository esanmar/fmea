Failure mode and effects analysis is the process of reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA software) FMEA software is an analytical methodology used to ensure that potential problems have been considered and addressed throughout the product and process development process. Part of the evaluation and analysis is the assessment of risk. The important point is that a discussion is conducted regarding the design (product or process), a review of the functions and any application changes, and the resulting risk of potential failure.

Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA software) is a systematic, proactive method for evaluating a process to identify where and how it might fail to assess the relative impact of different failures and to identify the parts of the process that are most in need of change. 
Teams use FMEA software to evaluate processes for possible failures and prevent them by correcting them proactively rather than reacting to adverse events after failures have occurred. This emphasis on prevention may reduce the risk of harm to both patients and staff. FMEA software is particularly useful in evaluating a new process before implementation and assessing the impact of a proposed change on an existing process.
